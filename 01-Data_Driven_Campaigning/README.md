## 01 - Data Driven Campaigning (2023)
In this team project as part of a seminar on data-driven campaigning, an election campaign for B90/The Greens was planned for a fictitious federal election in 2023. 

SWOT analyses as well as descriptive and inferential statistical methods were used to determine the strengths and weaknesses as well as the voter potential of the Greens. The election campaign was then planned precisely on the basis of the findings and corresponding election posters were designed.

The analyses were carried out using Stata on the basis of the GLES tracking individual dataset from October 2022. The core of the analysis is the multiple multinomial logistic regression model, in which the probabilities of individual voting decisions were modeled using several variables. For a better understanding, the exemplary selected predicted probabilities plot and studies on various attributions of issue competencies of the parties were also used.

The project won first place in the competition with the other teams.
