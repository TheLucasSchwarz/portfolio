Welcome to my Data Portfolio! 

I'm Lucas Schwarz, a passionate data enthusiast with a background in Political Science and Political Communication. Within this repository, I present a compilation of my data analysis and data science projects, showcasing my utilization of statistical analysis, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization techniques to derive insightful conclusions. These projects were conducted during my studies in Political Science and Political Communication, demonstrating my dedication to a data-driven research approach and my adeptness in handling diverse datasets and methodologies.

Explore my portfolio to witness my approach to various challenges, including statistical modeling, classification tasks, network analysis, and data storytelling. Whether analyzing voter potentials in data-driven campaigning contexts, examining communication strategies of political candidates across platforms, or assessing the impact of tax systems on equality, each project underscores my commitment to delivering impactful insights within the realm of political data analysis.

Feel free to delve into the code, explore the methodologies employed, and engage with the insights generated. I invite you to embark on this journey through the captivating world of data projects in Political Science, where each dataset harbors the potential for discovery and innovation.

Happy exploring!

## [01 - Data Driven Campaigning (2023)](https://github.com/TheLucasSchwarz/portfolio/tree/main/01-Data_Driven_Campaigning)
In a group project we conducted extensive data analyses to plan a fictitious German federal election campaign for B90/The Greens, utilizing multinomial logistic regression models among other techniques.

## 02 - Dynamics in televised election debates (2022)
I examined communication strategies and dynamics of candidates using specially collected data from TV debates for the 2021 federal election, complemented by network visualizations in R.

## 03 - Position becomes emotion? (2023)
In another group project we explored the connection between societal polarization and negative campaign rhetoric employing multi-level regression models, with expert data on negative campaigning and Europe-wide individual data.

## 04 - Analyzing political communication on Twitter with NLP (2024)
Utilizing PyTorch, pre-trained XLM-Ro-BERTa-Large models, and specially trained SpaCy models, I am currently analyzing political communication patterns in over 330,000 tweets from the 2021 German parliamentary election campaign. Stay tuned for updates on the insights and findings as this project progresses.

## 05 - From Tax to Equality (2024)
I investigated the impact of diverse tax policies on wealth inequality by analyzing macro-country data sourced from various reputable outlets. Employing a multiple linear fixed-effects panel model, I scrutinized data spanning over 25 OECD countries and approximately 25 years. This approach allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the intricate relationship between tax policies and wealth distribution dynamics.
 
## 06 - Economic causes of populist voting behavior (2022 and 2023)
In two projects I investigated left-wing and right-wing populist voting behavior in Europe, exploring the role of globalization, welfare states, and individual circumstances through multiple linear and multinomial regression models.
