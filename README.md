# Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Portfolio! 

I'm Lucas Schwarz, a passionate data enthusiast with a background in Political Science and Political Communication. Within this repository, I present a compilation of my data analysis and data science projects, showcasing my utilization of statistical analysis, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization techniques to derive insightful conclusions. These projects were conducted during my studies in Political Science and Political Communication, demonstrating my dedication to a data-driven research approach and my adeptness in handling diverse datasets and methodologies.

Explore my portfolio to witness my approach to various challenges, including statistical modeling, classification tasks, network analysis, and data storytelling. Whether analyzing voter potentials in data-driven campaigning contexts, examining communication strategies of political candidates across platforms, or assessing the impact of tax systems on equality, each project underscores my commitment to delivering impactful insights within the realm of political data analysis.

Feel free to delve into the code, explore the methodologies employed, and engage with the insights generated. I invite you to embark on this journey through the captivating world of data projects in Political Science, where each dataset harbors the potential for discovery and innovation.

Happy exploring!

## 01 - Data Driven Campaigning (2023)
On the basis of extensive data analyses on the voter potential of parties, a fictitious federal election campaign for B90/The Greens was planned using multinomial logistic regression models, among other things.

## 02 - Dynamics in televised election debates (2022)
The communication strategies and dynamics of the candidates were examined using specially collected data from the TV debates for the 2021 federal election with network visualizations in R.

## 03 - Position becomes emotion? (2023)
With the help of expert data on negative campaigning and Europe-wide individual data, the connection between polarization in society and negative campaign rhetoric was examined using multi-level regression models.

## 04 - Analyzing political communication on Twitter with NLP (2024)
In this current project, PyTorch and pre-trained XLM-Ro-BERTa-Large models as well as specially trained models based on the SpaCy library are used to analyze political communication patterns in over 330,000 tweets from the 2021 German parliamentary election campaign.
